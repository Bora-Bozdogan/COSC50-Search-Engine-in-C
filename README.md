# CS50 TSE
## Bora Bozdogan (Bora-Bozdogan)

ASSUMPTIONS and DIFFERENCES: 

I assumed we write the assumptions and differences here because of the note above
I wrote them to the crawler and common README.md as well, as github states I should
write them there.

I assumed that two types of directory inputs were possible
    1- ends with slash (../cs50dev/)
    2- doesn't end with slash (../cs50dev/)
    therefore I made the memory allocation a dynamic process ready for both cases.
