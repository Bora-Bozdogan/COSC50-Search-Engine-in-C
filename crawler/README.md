ASSUMPTIONS and DIFFERENCES: 

I assumed that two types of directory inputs were possible
    1- ends with slash (../cs50dev/)
    2- doesn't end with slash (../cs50dev/)
    therefore I made the memory allocation a dynamic process ready for both cases.

I assumed we're making the argument check in the main, as the function description doesn't involve
checking for argument count for parseArgs.
